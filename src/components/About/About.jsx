      Driven by a creative and methodical mindset, I am a full-stack developer with a background in e-commerce project management and a strong interest in technologies like React, Docker, and TypeScript.

What fascinates me about development is the opportunity to blend logic and aesthetics to craft web solutions that are both functional and visually engaging. I am also increasingly interested in DevOps practices and CI/CD pipelines, aiming to build more robust and efficient development workflows.

Outside of coding, I am active in the electronic music scene and enjoy exploring activities that spark my curiosity and creativity.
