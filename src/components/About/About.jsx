        Driven by a creative and methodical mindset, I am a full-stack developer
        with a background in e-commerce project management and a strong interest
        in tools like React, Docker, and TypeScript. What fascinates me about
        development is the opportunity to blend logic with aesthetics to create
        web solutions that are both effective and visually appealing. When Iâ€™m
        not at my screen, I engage in the electronic music scene and find time
        for activities that fuel my curious mind.
